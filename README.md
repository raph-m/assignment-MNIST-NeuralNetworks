Assignement on Deep Learning for the course INF 554 at Ecole Polytechnique.
The goal is to fully rewrite the implementation of a Neural Network and to test it on the MNIST dataset.
Then we investigated different parameters such as the activation function, the architecture of the neural network and the regularization function. 

You can just run the main and you will be asked the architecture you would like to use for the neural network. The algorithm will train on the dataset and print the test and train accuracies.
